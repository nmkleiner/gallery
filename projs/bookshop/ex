Books Shop (code name: book-shop)

Your challenge is to build a page that shows a list of books: id, name, price, imgUrl. We will allow the user – a shop owner – to manage the books.

1. Setup your project

a. Use a book-service to manage the books

2. Create your Model and show the books in a table. We will use a global variable gBooks, and a function renderBooks() that will draw the table
Now, let's handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)

3. Add an Actions column to the table (something like this :)
4. Handle delete - when the button clicked call onDeleteBook that will use the service's function deleteBook(bookId))
5. Support adding a new book:
a. When clicked, call the function readAndAddNewBook() that will read (prompt) the details from the user: name and price, then will call a function addBook(name, price) that pushes a new book into the gBooks model. Then call the renderTable() to redraw the table
6. Support updating a book:
a. When clicked, call the function: readAndUpdateBook (bookId) that will prompt for the book new price and call the service's function

updateBook(bookId, bookPrice). Then Call the renderTable() to redraw the table
7. Create a modal: Book Details, that shows the details of a selected book including its photo
a. When read is clicked, show the modal with details of the selected book.
b. Add a rate property for the book, set 0 as default, the rate should be a number between 0 and 10.
c. In the Book Details, allow the user to change the rate of the book by clicking the + / - buttons:
Bonus
1. Read the data from the user using an <input> instead of prompt
2. Make the header of the table clickable to support sorting by name or price
3. Add paging:
